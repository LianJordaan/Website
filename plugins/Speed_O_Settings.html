			<h3 id="dropdown-text">This plugin is the first plugin i have ever made that has a config file! When a player joins your server this plugin will wait 10 game ticks and then give the player a firework rocket that they can not drop nor move around in their inventory. They can right click while holding it and then access a speed settings gui. Using that speed settings gui they can change their speed anywhere from 1 to 5. They will then get the speed effect that will also be saved inside the config.yml every tick for 2 game ticks if they are in the world that you specified in the config.yml. This plugin is made for minecraft server version <b><u>paper 1.17.1</u></b> and tested on minecraft server version <b><u>paper 1.18.2</u></b>.<br>The default <u>config.yml</u> can be found <a href="../files/Speed_O_Settings-config.yml" download="config.yml" style="color: lightblue;">here</a>.<br>Below you will find a download to the plugin.jar file.</h3>
